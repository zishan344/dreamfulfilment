    <h1>1. Making a Plan</h1>
    <p>
        <b> Be specific about your dream.</b> The first thing you need to do is to be specific about your dream so you can be on your way to making it happen. One way to be very specific about your dreams is to write them in your dream journal or in a notebook. If you don't know what you really want, then you can't achieve it, can you? However, you can still start on your path before being 100% sure of what will happen. You just have to have an idea of what you want to happen and then find a way to narrow it down as you move closer and closer to your dream.
        For example, let's say you've always loved writing and want to be a real writer at the end of the day. You may not know whether you want to write novels, be a journalist, or even be an inspirational blogger, but you may have a better sense of what you want as you move in the right direction.
        Don't worry if you don't have it all figured out. Maybe your dream is just to find a job that makes you feel like you're making a real difference in the world. There are many ways to make this happen, and having a broad goal will help you get there.</p> <br>
        <h1>2. Turn your dream into a burning desire.</h1>
        <p> You will need to turn your dream into a burning desire in your heart. A strong will to achieve your dreams boosts self-confidence and will aid you in pulling through some of the worst stages of life. The way to turn your dream into a burning desire is to believe that your dream is achievable and that you can actually achieve it. If you just look at it as a general wish, such as losing five pounds this year, or wanting to move somewhere sunny without really doing it, then you won't be able to take it seriously.
            Once it has become a burning desire you are no longer to refer to it as a dream, because the very nature of a dream gives the impression that it is not real. You have to start thinking of it as something more.
            It is important to move from dream to burning desire, to goal. Only a goal can be approached.</p>
        <h1> 3. Turn your burning desires into goals.</h1>
       <p> You then need to turn your burning desire into a goal. You had earlier turned your dream into a burning desire because you believe it can be done and that you can do it. But to actually turn it into a goal, you need to believe that you will do it. This kind of believing is based on your commitment that if it can be done then you can do it, and that if you can do it, you can do it now. The thing about goals is they are time sensitive, so adding a time frame helps you to accept the fact that you are committed to doing it.[1]
           <ul>
               <li>Once you have turned your burning desire into a goal, you are no longer to call it a burning desire or a dream; it is now your goal in life, a goal that must be achieved by you.</li>
           </ul>
